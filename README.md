# Section RecyclerView

Implementation of RecyclerView with headers and items is too easy, which allows you to split a RecyclerView into sections with headers.ActivitiesAdapter is similar to Androidâ€™s [RecyclerView.Adapter](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/recyclerview/widget/RecyclerView.Adapter),which creates and binds ViewHolders.

## Advantages

* *Simple and Flexible.* Which is compatible with almost any external third-party library or API
* It is so easy to handle UI changes for headers,etc,.
* Here, there is no third-party library is used, meanwhile its working with native source.

This code is compatible for both java and kotlin users.
